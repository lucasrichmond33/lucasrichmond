    <br> Sophie and I did our project on "NETLogo Simulation Rabbits Grass Weeds"
    <br> In the program the user can adjust several factors to increase or decrease the Rabbit population.
    <br> We concluded that the more grass and the less weeds produced the most rabbits and the simulation was a solid representation of real life situations
